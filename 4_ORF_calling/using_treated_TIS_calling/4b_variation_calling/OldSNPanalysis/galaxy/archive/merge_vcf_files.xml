        This tool filters the variants in one or more VCF files by their allelic frequency, using the cut-off parameters provided by the user:
        
        a variant is retained when:
            allelic frequency &gt; high cut-off
            or
            lower cut-off &lt; allelic frequency &gt; upper cut-off
        
        The variants that pass the filter are written to a ";" separated .txt file.
        Why ; as a separator? Because you can't import tab separated files in SQLite.
        And why not a simple comma? Because whenever there is more than one variant at a certain genomic position, they are separated by comma's.
        
        Even if there was more than one input VCF file, all the results are written to the same text file.
        
        This is what the output file looks like:
